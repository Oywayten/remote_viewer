# Remote Viewer
> \- simple REST API application to get list of images from ftp server and get image by address.

## About the application
+ The application has four layers: Model, Controller, Service, Persistence, Configuration;
+ When accessing endpoint "/photos", it connects via FTP to the server and searches for files with the specified prefix (e.g. “GRP327_…”) from certain folders. As a result of the execution, it displays a list of found files with their full paths. The prefix and name of the search folders are specified in the application.properties file.
+ There is also an endpoint that allows you to get the image itself, e.g. /photo?path=/Users/Test/Фотозона/фотографии/GRP327_test.jpg
+ The application provides caching of requested images. The caching folder is specified in the application.properties file.
